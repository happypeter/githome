- buy surface enhancement glue 墙固
- buy plasterboard and steamroom board
- buy concrete work tools(if necessary)
- fix the gaps and holes on the wall with cement
- install windows
- install boards on the walls and ceilings
- floor heating

## style

- warm color is great https://youtu.be/9By4mh34Rvg?t=154

## Design Goals

- try to build everything modular/portable/usable as possible, cause I don't know when the gov will take down the whole village

## entryway

- MUST HAVES: mirror, tmper storage(a table or shelf), shoe stools

## furnature

- use drawers
  - especially for lower spaces, you don't need bend your back too much
    everytime
- all should have tall legs
  - floating is even better than tall legs
  - pros:
    - Nordic style, really make the space airy and spacious
    - Robot Vacuum friendly
    - easy to clean
  - cons:
    - always more expensive

## workbench

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNFnyD8gAYc

- lawn
  - it takes lots of time to take care of a lawn

## lighting

- I will go professional on lighting system

## Heating

- floor heating is good
  - it is most energy efficient way to do heating, not sure
  - with it, I don't need to worry about insulation for floor
- wood stove for the living room, living room is also the guest room
  - wood stove will be useful, when we have guest living in the room, or power
    outage.

## exteior/yard

- windows/doors
  - I want the all black, cause the house itself has to much details aready,
    white frame adds more lines to the general dark look
- yard wall
  - use wood on top of stone is good idea https://youtu.be/t4_2pRnSN4E?t=28
- sewer pipe https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eA411x79o

## concrete

- use foam as mold https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe_zL0B3EYU
  - use foam as skeleton https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGiRFZSLmTU
- don't do concrete when it still freezes at night
- make the whole house sealed well, otherwise a lot of small creature will be
  living in your country house.
- L share pillar to support the broken beam
  - even though the beam is poplar willow, wood is not good, but with that
    kind of thickness, it is more than enough to hold the roof even cracked.
  - I asked the two old man living in this kind of house for all their lives,
    they told me with 100% confidence that it is still as strong.

  - right out of house https://youtu.be/Qbf6r3CL8Fg?t=348
  - toliet cleanout https://youtu.be/bbqZ12QhoY4?t=62
- traps and vents
  - add filter at the end the vent line to keep small bugs away
  - p trap
    - the tail should not be too shore to avoid siphon. https://youtu.be/JrNv7svgzco?t=35
  - three floor drains(washing machine, toliet, shower) share one P trap
    - do I need a standpipe for my washing machine drain?
      - standpipe is there to avoid waster overflow for drains that not fast enough
      - I my case my P for washing machine is 75cm gaint pipe, so I probably not need a standpipe
      - however if I find overflow in the future, I will add the standpipe.
    - that is the the P for the middle of the three drain, the one used by washing machine, like https://www.quartzbyaco.com.au/how-to-design-a-bathroom-drainage-system/
    - don't bother to have a cleanout at the bottom/turn the P, make sure the drain cover of the middle/washing machine drain is easy to remove.
    - floor drains tend to dry very often, except the shower floor drain. Sharing means there is always water seal.
  - septic tank and toliet share one vent
  - have vents go alone the roof horizontally is a way to share https://youtu.be/C9Keoe0nh_E?t=102
  - kitchen use one vent, one vent between toliet and washing machine so they share one vent
  - avoid vent below flood level https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=243
  - use san tee to join vertial and horizontal https://youtu.be/bbqZ12QhoY4?t=325
  - use 50mm pipes for the vent(1.5 inch according to USA code https://youtu.be/bbqZ12QhoY4?
  - you can have multiple vents all connected to your main vent https://youtu.be/Y2o8upCxcqA?t=164
    - you need grade for the connecton https://youtu.be/bbqZ12QhoY4?t=284
- how to glue PVC
  - Not to glue at all
  - lay all pipes and fittings on site, then cut
  - wear water proof gloves for the glue
  - use grinder to get round edge of pipe wall for esay pluging in
  - use grinder to cut pipes https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rk4y1k7pw
  - plug everything together, place the whole line where it should go, then mark the angle of all the fittings https://youtu.be/yGgx_UFQIfw?t=183
  - the glue will melt the pipe, so make the pipe surface clean before applying the glue, use right glue for the pipe  https://youtu.be/yGgx_UFQIfw?t=218  you have 5 seconds to do it.
  - push to as far as you can go, trun the pipe a bit to make glue even, hold for 5 seconds https://youtu.be/VqBAMEbo-OE?t=87ß
- DONTs
  - don't expose pipes outside the finished walls, otherwise how can you install a cabinet neatly
  - don't use the main vent outlet too big, otherwise strong wind may
    lead to bounce of toliet water https://youtu.be/Y2o8upCxcqA?t=202
  - don't use chimney as main vent, it is upward facing, lose most heat, not easy to install one-way valve
    - I will seal all the chimneys before winter
  - don't have a drain you don't use very often, when the water seal dries, it is
    a smell hole.
  - don't use two tees together, use double tee https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=214
  - don't make too big slope, you will siphone out your p-trap https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=235
  - don't use short radius 90 degree fittings(for toliet or vent, short ones are OK) https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=395
  - don't use sanitary tee horizontally https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=105
    - use these https://youtu.be/w5fMZBRtQ24?t=132 for horizontally connect two pipes
    - use 45 degree if you want to turn https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=113
- toliet
  - from the center of the drain hole to side wall 15inch, the the back finished wall 12inch
    - I will make it 40cm to the finished wall, 48cm to the unfinished wall

  - at least 900mm under ground, 100mm sand under, 300mm sand above pipe
    - https://baike.baidu.com/item/UPVC%E7%AE%A1/10346548
  - use gravels to build a strong foundation for the pipes https://youtu.be/Qbf6r3CL8Fg?t=144
- septic tank
  - inlet hole center: 97cm deep, outlet hole: 100cm deep(ground to hole center)
  - 2m deep, 3m diameter(enough for ten years use MAYBE)
  - seal pipe penetration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLTaFf9Z1g
  - well cover the main access top hole to keep rain water away
  - inlet pipe 110mm dia PVC
  - needs to be burried under frozen earth https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1GE411a73c
  - https://youtu.be/ycrwcFXsAdA?t=32 Use a T pipe for outlet of a septic tank.
  - It's very common to have a one chamber tank, as long as you have a outlet
    pipe going uphill(in the case of my outlet pipe, the outside is 30cm or more higher then inside hole, with inside hole sink in water all the time), neither scum or sludge is a worry, cause inside water level will always be above outlet pipe hole
- leach field
  - I won't use pipes with smalls holes, I use concrete lid to cover the whole area and build concrete spacious channels underneath
    - then I don't need to have filters for the tank outlet, and I don't need to cover the gravels with cloth on the top https://youtu.be/LN4-ZcDuSUs?t=573
  - make the D-box really big, so I may be able to open it and clean the tunnels
  - make sure the underground is easily accessible during rain season, native people sometimes needs to pump the water out from their drywell.
  - why a drywell does not make it?
    - water table not deep enough in my yard
    - but after two resonable big rain with the manhole uncovered, the water level
    is still at the drain, that means the I can fill safe to dump how much water I want, so a leach filed may work well
  - DIY concrete slab https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys26t1daYjw
    - use lots of gravels, and you should keep the dirt away from the gravels https://youtu.be/SjZ95sGaD-k?t=485 I don't use cloth, but slab.

## Plumbing: incoming water/water supply
- prefilter
  - one day maybe I will get a after-filter https://youtu.be/QLm89HA4EFU?t=107
  - for big particals, sand, rust...these things are not just bad for human,
    but also may detroy your devices.
- materials
  - PE is more flexiable, used as outdoor water supply, ppr is harder, used as indoor water supply https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/141037695
  - my water main pipe is '白色自来水管子 PE 管' on Pinduoduo
    - diameter 20mm(seems a bit bigger than 20mm, but much much smaller than
    25mm)
    - this is called 4 分管 DN15,https://www.pipestd.com/schedule-std-pipe-1-2-inch-dn15-mm/
    - main land standard, the outside diamater is 20mm, US standard is 21.3mm
    - it is flexible enough to be buried undergrand and adjustable to the form
    changes overtime, therefore is widely used as long distance main city water pipe.
    because it's flexibility, you save a lot of fittings.
    - welding temperature 210 degree C
  - if your supply use 4(20mm) pipe, does not make a lot sense to use 6(25mm) pipe in home https://www.163.com/dy/article/FLHV3S95054034NQ.html
  - join metal pipe with ppr https://youtu.be/aUeyjugrdDM?t=264
  - yard faucet. make a hole on the wall, a faucet for the yard. https://youtu.be/cALQ3PR7k30?t=29
- hot melt 
  - hot melt connection is much secure than threaded connection
    - if buried in wall or ground, hot melt is a MUST
    - https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/111056055
    - hot melt is a great way to connect PE2PE or PPR2PPR, the joint merge in
      molecular level, the binding is even stronger than the material iteself. But
      PE2PPR is not a good idea, since PE and PPR has different molecule. - https://www.betterpipe.com/ppr-pe-hot-melt-connection/
  - water main facuet https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HJ411v7Dm/?t=52s
  - hot melt tricks https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1YE411w7KK
    - PPR needs 2 seconds 260DegreeC contact with the heater
    - rub the model surface when you are done
    - how to do it neatly https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1if4y1D7kM
      - don't melt too long part of the pipe
- water tank
  - use tank for kitchen and bathroom, but outdoor faucet should connect to
  water main directly for two reasons: NO.1 watering the plants uses lots of
  water, tank will be drained. NO.2 when water main pressure is not enough, then
  tank can not get water, a faucet not using tank is now a backup.
  - for 24hr water supply, I need to install a water tank
    - probably in the room where water main enters the house
- incoming water come into the yard from west side, I suppose
  - I am convinced of this after I did trenches for the sewer.
- have a main valve hidden inside cabinet
- all the joint were well melted together, except the old PE pipe to new PE pipe elbow. It's not as strong as other joint, and the melted material may takes some room inside the pipe. so when have oppotunity, replace that.
- consider install heater and filter for water main, then you have clean and hot water for the whole house https://kids.britannica.com/students/assembly/view/107334

## Insulation
- why I can not have insulation false ceiling?
  - once I have false ceiling. ventilation is MUST in winter to prevent the
    wood to rot
    - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1cy4y117Tc according to him ventilation
      is not always necessary for wood
  - but then I have to build a very thick false ceiling to stop the coldness
    in attic space and make the original 10cm concrete heat proofing roof useless
  - out door air connected ventilation is a MUST, espeially in winter
    - I may need to install a professional heat recovery ventilator to push the air flow and
      keep bugs away
- roof insulation, replace the clay layer with foam/rockfiber, https://youtu.be/ibjiChTQZEI?t=105
  - Me: use some rockfiber, and do add a vapor barrier
  - masterLi: cover everything with drywall, seal the drywall perfectly, that's means no venting for the beams and rafters, he's confident that will cause no trouble. I like the idea, plasterboard is now another layer of insulation. Now the false ceiling is part of the roof, so I don't have a attic space really, just a compact roof. But, for security, I may check the wood behind the plasterboard from time to time.
- material
  - wear mask and long sleeves to install both firberglass and stonewool https://youtu.be/wH4Oyj4fNxQ?t=503
  - fiberglass holds the water BAD https://youtu.be/5OEvZXSNaoY?t=209
    - Rockwool won't change shape due to water(dementional stability), lower thermal drift
      - not absorbant to water, water proof https://youtu.be/wH4Oyj4fNxQ?t=386
      - https://youtu.be/3hBoPcNtL54?t=1252
    - rockwool is a better product, and is twice as expensive https://youtu.be/wH4Oyj4fNxQ?t=284
    - the r value all come from how much air they trap https://youtu.be/wH4Oyj4fNxQ?t=316
  - https://youtu.be/OJ9u3pDQeM4?t=71
    - 'closed cell spray foam' is special, the rest are all about the same r
      value, around 3.6
- “Houses need to BREATHE!” - Shut your filthy mouth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIcrXut_EFA
  - we need the house be perfectly air-tight, then we need controlled
    ventilation system
- four layers to control
  - water, air, Vapor, Thermal(insulation)
- why well-sealed false ceiling and everything?
  - the biggest heat killer winter is air flow https://youtu.be/BDTYAz6pEHY?t=389
  - how? https://youtu.be/vShj1l0PnF0?t=238 plastic sheets
  - air flow prevention with spray foam https://youtu.be/1BcqeQJqp08?t=135
  - exhaust fans are big enemies to sealing https://youtu.be/1BcqeQJqp08?t=586
- How to vent attic space?
  - my father's house use shingle vent plus gable vent, that's a lot of
    venting, that's why the attic area is always same temperature as outer
    space, as it should. - https://youtu.be/ckXfYty_Cqg?t=90 'you attic air is supposed to be the
    same temperature as the outdoor air', of course, if you intentionally
    have small vents, you can get a warmer attic, then you are doing it wrong, end
    up with ice dams and ruin your house.
  - https://youtu.be/vShj1l0PnF0?t=59 Both high and low vents are needed to get
    good circulation.
  - Eave vent as low vent, Roof vent as high.
  - how big should the vents be?
    - 1 to 150 rule https://youtu.be/vShj1l0PnF0?t=238
    - use 1 to 300 rule if you have enough high vents
- To false ceiling, or Not to?
  - in my case, having a compact unvented roof is a clear win
    - attic space is usually as cold as outer space, that's how it works,
      otherwise it's not a properly vented attic, you will have problems like
    - I will do false ceiling, but my insulation will be done on the underside
      of the roof, so my attic is a conditioned space https://youtu.be/VcRPGQoeO9Q?t=107 ice daming or sth
      - spary foam is perfect match for conditioned attic https://youtu.be/F7D4Q3mjgdQ?t=201 and it's common pratictise in USA
  - I need to know the R-value of my current roof, that is the flyash layer.
  - false ceiling is always air leaking, no matter how hard you try to prevent
    that, since people run cable above the ceiling, you always need holes to install all sorts of devices. https://youtu.be/1BcqeQJqp08?t=1296, while my flyash baby is water proof, so is also mostly air tight.
    - even the expert promoting it can not say vented attic always
      win https://youtu.be/Ld8pzIu45F8?t=1397
    - use false ceiling just for hiding ugly things, while use real roof for
      heat/wind/water isolation, seems to be such a good modular design.
- why vented attic space?

  - even the guy who promote home-temprature attic space wants ventilation for
    the rafters https://youtu.be/6F_IkZJ8NOY?t=209 'a vented roof, but unvented attic'
    - building dusts in vented attic space is a bad idea https://youtu.be/Ld8pzIu45F8?t=233 the reason they want 'unvented attic' is for the ducts of HVAC system,
      which don't apply to my case here.
  - without ventilation, a false ceiling will makes the room hotter at summer
    night.
  - without ventilation, roof gets warm in winter, so you get ice dams https://youtu.be/6F_IkZJ8NOY?t=223
  - ice dam can cause water leaking for your roof https://youtu.be/VcRPGQoeO9Q?t=44
  - ice dams shows up, because your whole roof(with or without attic space)
    is poorly insulated, and you should do sth about your roof.
  - https://youtu.be/Ld8pzIu45F8?t=837: if you just have a r60 roof, you can
    make it unvented in a cold climate because you don't have to vent it to - you need a minimum r38 https://youtu.be/VcRPGQoeO9Q?t=107 - spary foam is the only way to get r38 with given space https://youtu.be/VcRPGQoeO9Q?t=177 - you need 30cm firberglass to reach r38 - Closed-cell spray foam has an R-Value of R6-6.5 per inch.
    control ice daming. (But when the snow is too thick, it will have its own r
    value, and ice daming will happen again, but that's not sth I need to worry
    about)
- how to insulate without attic?
  - have a nice compact roof(as the house was built)
  - use film above plasterboard https://youtu.be/ZLcfYZqpGXQ?t=5
  - bury wood in fiberglass https://youtu.be/ZLcfYZqpGXQ?t=138
  - insulation on top of roof(with air insulation and barrier) also works https://youtu.be/Ld8pzIu45F8?t=1739
  - search '屋顶隔热', I got nice thick foam with foil on one side and glue
    on the other, which I think is a good solution.
- will the ventilation drastically decrease interior temrator
  - It is easy to test by plugging the vent for one day or two.
  - ventilation is kind of necessary, as they say 'if you can not ventilate,
    don't insulate'
- a perfect sealed ceiling
  - MUST: air-proof ceiling, seal even the light holes well
  - and then have vented attic
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld8pzIu45F8
- walls
  - make exterior wind resistant, interior heat resistant
  - Wangpeng suggested if we have thick wall, we don't really need wall
    insulation so much. I aggree, at least not as key as ceiling/floor/windows.
- ceiling
  - aviod condensation/ventilation
    - old houses don't need ventilation to avoid moisture, partly because they
      have chimneys https://youtu.be/QEPzyrynU6Q?t=299
      - and also because the glazing is poor and foam is lacking, the inside
        is not so warm and thus not so easy to have mositure anyway.
      - does all the house need ventilation? Maybe NOT. https://youtu.be/QEPzyrynU6Q?t=430
        - the the bathroom ceiling must be well sealed, and Maybe do a
          vent to other room(if not outer space)
    - https://youtu.be/dee7g_HtMIQ?t=94 this video suggest, if you have false
      ceiling, a vent for attic space is a MUST
    - so my plan is not to vent to outside space(e.g eave vent), but make big vent to indoor
      space with a trap door(make the trap door fully sealable, and open it in witer to check the moisture rate of the roof), and use foam to cover the concrete room to avoid condensation, so the false ceiling is generally designed for aesthetic reason, not for insulation.

  - depending on where you have a vent to outside the house in your attic
    space, you maybe need to do insulation on ceiling or false ceiling

  - 'Insulation only work when you don't have air movement', aka, sealed well
- windows
  - windows needs to be protected from summer sun https://youtu.be/xepx8yp1IPM?t=206
  - invest in three layer glass windows to save heating cost
  - same logic here, build a shed to shelter the west wall from setting sun

  - Shining and heat reflecting coating may be applied on the top of exposed roof like paint.
  - These coatings can serve dual purpose of water proofing and heat reflection.
  - In case of flat roof you can create air space on top of roof by placing asbestos sheet on brick pillars.

  - paste a film on top of the roof, search 拼多多 '防晒隔热膜'

## laundry
- wall hung hampers
- hang basins and everything

## Living Room
- living room also bedroom, so wo need a versatile bed
- a bed https://youtu.be/0df9v3xCzeU?t=85
- sofa bed https://youtu.be/XwjFD6romAY?t=43

## Bathroom
- toliet needs to stay in it's own room
  - not together with anything, not shower, not washing machine
  - needs a powerful sparyer for its own
- wet and dry zone
  - shower is definetly wet zone, so requires its own drain and floor water barrier
- why not a all-in-one portable prefabricated toliet unit?
  - the floor is above the room floor, not safe when floor is wet
  - I don't think I need a door for the toliet
  - I want to share a exhaust fan with shower
    - MasterLi: hide the fan behind plasterboard(Chinese drywell, 石膏板), drill a hole on the wall, share the hole with drainline venting
  - so some simple half-transparent 1.5m glass screen will do
  - I will build everything(shower/toliet) right on the floor and use black frame glass as seperators
- wall hung vanity
  - just a small basin, no need for extra space, otherwise more clean work
  - no drawer or cabinet needed, install floating shelves on the side
- hang everything
- vent

- structure
  - I check several half-destroyed same style houses in 慕义寨, the wood is in perfect
    condition. Clay is part of the roof, between concrete and grass.
  - walls seperating two rooms are not load-bearing, I may remove them to get
    bigger space.
  - from my obsevation, I don't need to worry about the structure. When a
  - Is cracked timber still safe? Yes! https://www.homesteadstructures.com/blog/why-are-there-cracks-timber-my-new-timber-frame-structure - this firbers are not broken, even a bundle of chopsticks are super
    strong, right, so some gaps along the fiber direction do not hurt the
    structural integrity a lot. - However, if a wood beam has split all the way through, you’ll definitely want to investigate further and test structural integrity.
    house of this type gets too old and some parts start to decay, it starts from thin wood sticks extended
    out side the main roof, 出头的椽子先烂.

## Basic Info
- Why I love the new githome
  - no tall building in front to stop the light in winter and wind in summer
  - septic tank in the yard
- structure
  - roof is build with a once piece concrete thing, felt safe walking on top
- sizes
  - yard: 15.5x48.5 steps, one step is 60cm, so 9.3x29.1sm=270sm
  - wall thickness: some 48cm
  - interior width: 470cm
  - exterior length: some 10m
  - so inside space is: 9mx4.7m=42.3m2
  - ceiling height: 320cm

## Kitchen
- floor must be un sticky to stains, choose the right painting
- have two bowl sink, mum will use one as her swill bucket
- fridge should not be put in kitchen
  - hot, close to stove
  - make kitchen hard to mop
  - no need, things in fridge are usually not dirty or leaky
  - dinning room is a good place
- different height for sink and stove https://www.sohu.com/a/161454935_99890682
- install counterop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLi0ZVJKzYM
- build a U shape counter with one side against the north wall
  - lighting should not be a problem, the north side gets a windows, the west and east side all gets sunshine from south

## cleaning system
- hang everything
  - including toliet
- mop
  - old style string mob and a platic bucket to take every where.
  - don't build fixed basin for mop, it is not safe enough.
  - this is good `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w3E8isgONE`
- swill bucket
  - with filter and drain at the bottom of course

## interior surface (walls, ceiling and floors)
- materials
  - use steam room board 桑拿板 for the wall
    - it's perfectly OK to mix steamroom board with white
    - so I think I will use steamroom board for kitchen and bath
      - toliet https://www.pinterest.jp/pin/717057571924820193/
      - kitchen ceiling https://www.pinterest.jp/pin/AZrSbmjzpQWevqzDmTWfPDUoTaw2iwwmQGSAx2HxqMv8-Wtf_9CbnyQ/
      - bath https://www.sohu.com/a/352211714_559938 https://www.pinterest.jp/pin/351912460681803/ https://www.pinterest.jp/pin/805581452086030279/ https://www.pinterest.jp/pin/427067977167172517/
  - kitchen wall in front of stove?
    - use large piece of wood board, cover with some special painting or wall paper that is easy to clean
  - I don't like Porcelain tile, cause it is not reusable
  - can I use steamroom board in place of
  - use 生态板 plywood if you want solid feel for the wall
  - use plasterboard when for ceiling and where you need to open holes, cause its clean look
  - try to use more expensiv [e wood because its reusable

- use water-proof plaster for kitchen/bathroom
  - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1oU4y1H7R4
- ceiling
  - cover everything with drywall, wrap around beam to keep the height of the room
  - it's a good idea brought by MasterLi
  - as to insulation and venting, check insulation
- ceiling basic info
  - beam to floor height: 259cm
  - rafter: 12cm diameter and 172cm long
  - structure: fix rotten rafters, support the broken beam with a pillar
  - aesthetic: hide everything(beams, rafters, cable pipes) with platerboard ceiling
    - leave a vent on the ceiling, let room air go freely to the attic space, so
      we don't need real ventilation
      - https://youtu.be/dee7g_HtMIQ?t=95
    - so the false ceiling is not for insulation
- use wood frame to hold plasterboard for the false ceiling, so that I can nail for
  lighting fixtures.
- https://youtu.be/weTsUYj0FXI?t=769 condensation is the root of all evil,
  when it comes rotten wood.
- HOWTO build the false ceiling https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Sy4y1m7PY
  - wood frame is not for plasterboard ceiling, if you don't want cracks
- About wood https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1cy4y117Tc
  - most wood is now imported from other countries
  - the wood is pre-processed to kill bugs and dried
- bath ceiling
  - water proof drywall https://www.zhihu.com/zvideo/1346402176063963138
    - 180RMB/sqm
- the roof was built with fly ash, very good heat isulator, strong enough as
  part of the sturcture, I went to 慕义寨, checked other old house, the roofs
  are all in good shape.
- Floor
  - I still love 自流平 cement floor.
  - after finishing the base layers, give it a week before you do the hard surface
  - self leveling concrete https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Zv411k7zU?t=1m52s
- use wood frames like a typical US home does https://youtu.be/Arkq3lLuo0U?t=476
- walls
  - So once the wall surface is cleaned
  - firstly I need to enhance the structure
  - use wall glue 墙固 to keep the clay layer from falling in the future, as MasterLi guided.
    - add 15% water, don't spray, paint.
  - use plasterboard for all the walls, to hide pipes and water tanks
- some ceilings may also use drywall
  - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17t4y1D74f/

## windows and doors
- use black/drakgray windows, because the house aleadys have a lot of white shape or lines decorations, black is kind of invisible, does not add more details
- pocket doors or barn doors are nice interior options

## Portable Home? or not
- Inflation is here, it make a lot of sense to own my own tools/cars/materials to secure my wealth.
  - Things are also best hedge to my stocks/coins.
- begin with a shipping container workspace https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjU7QKcEUFY
- 深河大集 bazzar is the place to buy second hand shipping container houses
- serious considering build with shipping containers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvUI3-0QkI0
  - purchasable in china https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1dK411J7kS
- drawbacks
  - doing structural work is generally against my philosophy, which is only work on things need to be custimized. Everyone want a strong spacious rooms, that should be build by professionals with large machines, not me by hand.
    - people is building and have done a lot of strong houses, should be cheap to rent
  - even you build with shipping container, you still needs a strong foundation and all the plumbing, and yard and its walls, that's not go without cost.
