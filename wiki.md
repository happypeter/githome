  - three floor drains(washing machine, toliet, shower) share one P trap
    - do I need a standpipe for my washing machine drain?
      - standpipe is there to avoid waster overflow for drains that not fast enough
      - I my case my P for washing machine is 75cm gaint pipe, so I probably not need a standpipe
      - however if I find overflow in the future, I will add the standpipe.
    - that is the the P for the middle of the three drain, the one used by washing machine, like https://www.quartzbyaco.com.au/how-to-design-a-bathroom-drainage-system/
    - don't bother to have a cleanout at the bottom/turn the P, make sure the drain cover of the middle/washing machine drain is easy to remove.
    - floor drains tend to dry very often, except the shower floor drain. Sharing means there is always water seal.
  - septic tank and toliet share one vent
  - have vents go alone the roof horizontally is a way to share https://youtu.be/C9Keoe0nh_E?t=102
  - kitchen use one vent, one vent between toliet and washing machine so they share one vent
  - avoid vent below flood level https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=243
  - use san tee to join vertial and horizontal https://youtu.be/bbqZ12QhoY4?t=325
  - use 50mm pipes for the vent(1.5 inch according to USA code https://youtu.be/bbqZ12QhoY4?
  - you can have multiple vents all connected to your main vent https://youtu.be/Y2o8upCxcqA?t=164
    - you need grade for the connecton https://youtu.be/bbqZ12QhoY4?t=284
- how to glue PVC
  - Not to glue at all
  - use grinder to get round edge of pipe wall for esay pluging in
  - use grinder to cut pipes https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rk4y1k7pw
  - plug everything together, place the whole line where it should go, then mark the angle of all the fittings https://youtu.be/yGgx_UFQIfw?t=183
  - the glue will melt the pipe, so make the pipe surface clean before applying the glue, use right glue for the pipe  https://youtu.be/yGgx_UFQIfw?t=218  you have 5 seconds to do it.
  - push to as far as you can go, trun the pipe a bit to make glue even, hold for 5 seconds https://youtu.be/VqBAMEbo-OE?t=87ß
- DONTs
  - don't expose pipes outside the finished walls, otherwise how can you install a cabinet neatly
  - don't use the main vent outlet too big, otherwise strong wind may
    lead to bounce of toliet water https://youtu.be/Y2o8upCxcqA?t=202
  - don't have a drain you don't use very often, when the water seal dries, it is
    a smell hole.
  - don't use two tees together, use double tee https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=214
  - don't make too big slope, you will siphone out your p-trap https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=235
  - don't use short radius 90 degree fittings(for toliet or vent, short ones are OK) https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=395
  - don't use sanitary tee horizontally https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=105
    - use these https://youtu.be/w5fMZBRtQ24?t=132 for horizontally connect two pipes
    - use 45 degree if you want to turn https://youtu.be/xpsLXmntINE?t=113
- toliet

  - use gravels to build a strong foundation for the pipes https://youtu.be/Qbf6r3CL8Fg?t=144
- septic tank
  - inlet hole center: 97cm deep, outlet hole: 100cm deep(ground to hole center)
  - 2m deep, 3m diameter(enough for ten years use MAYBE)
  - seal pipe penetration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGLTaFf9Z1g
  - well cover the main access top hole to keep rain water away
  - inlet pipe 110mm dia PVC
  - needs to be burried under frozen earth https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1GE411a73c
  - https://youtu.be/ycrwcFXsAdA?t=32 Use a T pipe for outlet of a septic tank.
  - It's very common to have a one chamber tank, as long as you have a outlet
    pipe going uphill(in the case of my outlet pipe, the outside is 30cm or more higher then inside hole, with inside hole sink in water all the time), neither scum or sludge is a worry, cause inside water level will always be above outlet pipe hole
- leach field
  - I won't use pipes with smalls holes, I use concrete lid to cover the whole area and build concrete spacious channels underneath
    - then I don't need to have filters for the tank outlet, and I don't need to cover the gravels with cloth on the top https://youtu.be/LN4-ZcDuSUs?t=573
  - make the D-box really big, so I may be able to open it and clean the tunnels
  - make sure the underground is easily accessible during rain season, native people sometimes needs to pump the water out from their drywell.
  - why a drywell does not make it?
    - water table not deep enough in my yard
    - but after two resonable big rain with the manhole uncovered, the water level
    is still at the drain, that means the I can fill safe to dump how much water I want, so a leach filed may work well
  - DIY concrete slab https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys26t1daYjw
    - use lots of gravels, and you should keep the dirt away from the gravels https://youtu.be/SjZ95sGaD-k?t=485 I don't use cloth, but slab.

- materials
  - PE is more flexiable, used as outdoor water supply, ppr is harder, used as indoor water supply https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/141037695
  - my water main pipe is '白色自来水管子 PE 管' on Pinduoduo
    - diameter 20mm(seems a bit bigger than 20mm, but much much smaller than
    25mm)
    - this is called 4 分管 DN15,https://www.pipestd.com/schedule-std-pipe-1-2-inch-dn15-mm/
    - main land standard, the outside diamater is 20mm, US standard is 21.3mm
    - it is flexible enough to be buried undergrand and adjustable to the form
    changes overtime, therefore is widely used as long distance main city water pipe.
    because it's flexibility, you save a lot of fittings.
    - welding temperature 210 degree C
  - if your supply use 4(20mm) pipe, does not make a lot sense to use 6(25mm) pipe in home https://www.163.com/dy/article/FLHV3S95054034NQ.html
  - join metal pipe with ppr https://youtu.be/aUeyjugrdDM?t=264
  - yard faucet. make a hole on the wall, a faucet for the yard. https://youtu.be/cALQ3PR7k30?t=29
- hot melt 
  - hot melt connection is much secure than threaded connection
    - if buried in wall or ground, hot melt is a MUST
    - https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/111056055
    - hot melt is a great way to connect PE2PE or PPR2PPR, the joint merge in
      molecular level, the binding is even stronger than the material iteself. But
      PE2PPR is not a good idea, since PE and PPR has different molecule. - https://www.betterpipe.com/ppr-pe-hot-melt-connection/

      - don't melt too long part of the pipe
- water tank
  - use tank for kitchen and bathroom, but outdoor faucet should connect to
  water main directly for two reasons: NO.1 watering the plants uses lots of
  water, tank will be drained. NO.2 when water main pressure is not enough, then
  tank can not get water, a faucet not using tank is now a backup.
  - for 24hr water supply, I need to install a water tank
    - probably in the room where water main enters the house
- incoming water come into the yard from west side, I suppose
  - I am convinced of this after I did trenches for the sewer.
- have a main valve hidden inside cabinet
- all the joint were well melted together, except the old PE pipe to new PE pipe elbow. It's not as strong as other joint, and the melted material may takes some room inside the pipe. so when have oppotunity, replace that.
- consider install heater and filter for water main, then you have clean and hot water for the whole house https://kids.britannica.com/students/assembly/view/107334

## insulations

- why vented attic space?


  - without ventilation, roof gets warm in winter, so you get ice dams https://youtu.be/6F_IkZJ8NOY?t=223
  - ice dam can cause water leaking for your roof https://youtu.be/VcRPGQoeO9Q?t=44
  - ice dams shows up, because your whole roof(with or without attic space)
    is poorly insulated, and you should do sth about your roof.
  - https://youtu.be/Ld8pzIu45F8?t=837: if you just have a r60 roof, you can
    make it unvented in a cold climate because you don't have to vent it to - you need a minimum r38 https://youtu.be/VcRPGQoeO9Q?t=107 - spary foam is the only way to get r38 with given space https://youtu.be/VcRPGQoeO9Q?t=177 - you need 30cm firberglass to reach r38 - Closed-cell spray foam has an R-Value of R6-6.5 per inch.
    control ice daming. (But when the snow is too thick, it will have its own r
    value, and ice daming will happen again, but that's not sth I need to worry
    about)
- how to insulate without attic?
  - have a nice compact roof(as the house was built)
  - use film above plasterboard https://youtu.be/ZLcfYZqpGXQ?t=5
  - bury wood in fiberglass https://youtu.be/ZLcfYZqpGXQ?t=138
  - insulation on top of roof(with air insulation and barrier) also works https://youtu.be/Ld8pzIu45F8?t=1739
  - search '屋顶隔热', I got nice thick foam with foil on one side and glue
    on the other, which I think is a good solution.
- will the ventilation drastically decrease interior temrator
  - It is easy to test by plugging the vent for one day or two.
  - ventilation is kind of necessary, as they say 'if you can not ventilate,
    don't insulate'
- a perfect sealed ceiling
  - MUST: air-proof ceiling, seal even the light holes well
  - and then have vented attic
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld8pzIu45F8
- walls
  - make exterior wind resistant, interior heat resistant
  - Wangpeng suggested if we have thick wall, we don't really need wall
    insulation so much. I aggree, at least not as key as ceiling/floor/windows.



##  windows
  - windows needs to be protected from summer sun https://youtu.be/xepx8yp1IPM?t=206
  - invest in three layer glass windows to save heating cost
  - why not vinle windows?
    - welded corner is not aesthetic https://youtu.be/wyyM5es8MeI?t=34
    - aluminum is much more easier to install(maybe uninstall)https://www.jyjbs.com/lhj/1613.html

## Basic Info
- Why I love the new githome
  - no tall building in front to stop the light in winter and wind in summer
  - septic tank in the yard
- structure
  - roof is build with a once piece concrete thing, felt safe walking on top
- sizes
  - yard: 15.5x48.5 steps, one step is 60cm, so 9.3x29.1sm=270sm
  - wall thickness: some 48cm
  - interior width: 470cm
  - exterior length: some 10m
  - so inside space is: 9mx4.7m=42.3m2
  - ceiling height: 320cm

## Kitchen

- sink counter
  - PDD white cabinet I bookmarked
- floor must be un sticky to stains, choose the right painting
- have two bowl sink, mum will use one as her swill bucket
- fridge should not be put in kitchen
  - hot, close to stove
  - make kitchen hard to mop
  - no need, things in fridge are usually not dirty or leaky
  - dinning room is a good place
- different height for sink and stove https://www.sohu.com/a/161454935_99890682


## Portable Home? or not
- Inflation is here, it make a lot of sense to own my own tools/cars/materials to secure my wealth.
  - Things are also best hedge to my stocks/coins.
- begin with a shipping container workspace https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjU7QKcEUFY
- 深河大集 bazzar is the place to buy second hand shipping container houses
- serious considering build with shipping containers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvUI3-0QkI0
  - purchasable in china https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1dK411J7kS
- drawbacks
  - doing structural work is generally against my philosophy, which is only work on things need to be custimized. Everyone want a strong spacious rooms, that should be build by professionals with large machines, not me by hand.
    - people is building and have done a lot of strong houses, should be cheap to rent
  - even you build with shipping container, you still needs a strong foundation and all the plumbing, and yard and its walls, that's not go without cost.

## rent_requirments

- my dream home
  - a big open space = living room + dinning room + kitchen
    - its really trendy to have open space https://youtu.be/7BB3YYy8RVw?t=60
    - living room is mainly for projector and crafts
    - share sunshine and maybe more importantly share heating
    - kitchen should have bigger countertop than my current one, enough space for both cutting board and draining rack. No small oily corners. preferably enough space for long hanging rod
  - better to have yards
  - bedroom/office for me and Billie each
    - just a big bedroom, big enough and face south
  - a classroom for Kid
    - this should be in its own room, not in the living room
    - so when Elon is taught, Billie or me is two doors away
  - a laundry room with sunshine to dry clothes
  - toliets have part of the day sunshine(e.g facing east/west) and a natural ventilation(a real window)
  - a open balcony
  - so it's
    dream home = (1 big + 4 medium)sunny rooms + (2toilets +
- can I rent a old apartment? yes, the interior look does not matter, search '出租屋 改造‘ on

  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgcTbLfChV4

- can I rent a poor condition country home(little gated complex)?

  - I am not ready for this.
  - Note all the details in a finished apartment are there for a reason. Not to mention plumbing or heating, even minor things as trims are also cause troble when you try to clean the floor with mop when missing. Sure, you can do that if you want to spend money, but make sure you gurantee a at least 3-year contract with landlord, since it's no small investment.
  - the plumbing is for sure be frozen in winter!!
  - think about how much money to change those poor condition windows to be heating friendly

- requirements

  - network?
  - far enough from noisy traffic?
  - far from noisy dogs?
  - soundproof windows/wall/door
  - proper heating friendly walls/windows?
  - warm bathroom and toilet (consider lady's period)
  - no furniture preferably
  - window size, sunshine
  - DIY tolerant landlord
  - no bugs, espicially those who bite you
  - cooking stove? natural gas?
  - kitchen hood?
  - toliet bowl?
  - windows sealed well? thick walls?
  - noisy? dogs?
  - open space = living room + dinning room + kitchen

- why a poor countryside gated complex?
  - If Musk can build a house on Mars, I can make my accommadation in remote rurals
  - this goal is not to save money, but to understand engineering more deeply, by building things with my own hands.
- design guideline
  - Keyword: standard
    - All the material must be easy and cheap to buy, say I will use concrete to build my sideway, rather than old bricks from old building.
    - Every detail shoud be easily documentable, and every detail is there for a reason, form follows functionality. No fancy tricks for my tempeorary aesthetic taste.
    - the whole design must be very portable to another old country homestead.
    - standardization is a prerequisite for automation
    - think in system, e.g every part of the building should follow the same exterior design and palette.
- the name
  - the gated complex will look techy, demostrate ideas like industrilization and standardization.
- vertical space
  - follow my $shelf_box_system , don't buy things you won't be using for the rest of your life, just for the renovation period. So I will use wood to build my ladders and ladder stools.
- house exterior look
  - white wall + black window/door frame https://youtu.be/qUev14WrTV0?t=86

- youtube channel 建房子的豆壳儿
- 轻钢 light steel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmxkUiQ2T_c
  - <1mm thickness, it's really suprising
  - even students can build the house by hand https://youtu.be/UGQfAII0hF0?t=55
  - but the structure is super safe, it actully just need far less steel to hold the weight of everythings, but the problem is steel is easy to be twisted,, that's why people need to use more steel for the structure. Anyway, it's super safe for things like earthquick.
  - https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/246386753619278204.html
  - after years of use, the steel is still 100 percent
    recyclable
  - the wall is also super heat keeping, you save 75% money on heating
  - esay to be prefabricated, industrialization friendly
  - only problem: might produce some noise inside rooms
  - https://youtu.be/XRTNKDUW2uw?t=24
    - 2000rmb/m2 for everything
    - 30w for 150m2
    - https://youtu.be/XRTNKDUW2uw?t=75 you can have a comtempary style hourse with light steel
      - 7200~7500rmb/ton 25~30m2/ton, so for a 150m2 house, the steel is just 50000RMB

## Sewer

- Kitchen sewer tank https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uE411q7GJ
- no sewer solution for toilet https://youtu.be/UGQfAII0hF0?t=267
- https://youtu.be/CoFuQZBPCKo?t=213
  - 'sewer systems at their core are a bunch of sloped piped drains that take your waste from your house to a treatment plant...for the most part...Gravaty does all the work'
  - so the slope is key when I try to build my own toliet/kitchen sewer
  - building a home sewer system is not cheap, to have the slope and keep the pipe from frozen, you need to dig deep https://youtu.be/D1cDwRWekD0?t=133 you need digging machines to do the job https://youtu.be/npVOvrDJGsw?t=35

- you can build the stove in the center https://youtu.be/RzPCB8ES_xc?t=102

  - stove in the wall https://youtu.be/3n3JWNoUALI?t=129

- it make a lot of sense to have a open space, if you want to save on heating
  - get every functionality really close to each other, share light/air/heat. Keeping people together all the time, human bodies are also heating sources.
- air conditioner
  - cons
    - air exchange with outside, make rooms very dry
    - windy & unconfortable
- baseboard heater
