## 20210311 PE vs PPR

shopping for pipe parts, now I see how to connect PPR and PE, and wh en to use hot melt and when threaded joint

## 20210312 Pipe is 20cm

measured diamater of my new pipe, the old pipe, they all bigger than 20cm, I gets small errors are common, and should not cause issue when I do hot melting. And, building brick road is fun.

## 20210318 Hotmelt Pipes

now I am master of water. Hotmelted PE and PPR pipes, all was done perfectly, except the most important one the old pipe to PE elbow joint. But I did another old pipe to PE T fitting, and then do pull and Smash test will piler and hammer, it is rock solid. This gave me some confidence on the bad elbow joint. P.S I did a lot of trails and wasted some pipe and fittings.

## 20210319 Rainy Day

Take a day off, more research on plumping.

## 20210320 Water Main

water pipes are buried no less than 35cm deep, much more deep then the original depth, the shelves/tables/stools really helped
[img](imgs/20210320/)

## 20210321 Plumping

## 20210403 Show Githome To Everybody

My sister and Mum are my client, sort of, I will try to make them love Githome. [img](imgs/20210403)

## 20210404 Help from Mom and WangPeng

First time used a chain saw. Build my first concrete slab. Took door off with
grinder.
[img](imgs/20210406)

## 20210407 Day Off

More research on plumping.

## 20210408 Drywell

Done a lot. NO.1 Installed smart toliet, it's awesome. NO.2 Excavator took
down the concrete cow feeders. NO.3 trench and drywell hole(2.2m deep, reach
water table). NO.4 Build the drywell, use big brick block to cover the water,
then use small brick block to build a flat surface for the bottom of drywell,
then use gravels, then use sand to make the surface really flat, with the help
of my level. The last three imgs are snapshot from Bilibili videos, I am
inspired to change the way I lay down the bricks, and make the well larger
tomorrow.
[img](imgs/20210408)

## 20210409 Day Off

## 20210410 Destroy the Inlet Concrete

Made the hole trough the wall. Destroyed the inlet concrete structure. More
bricks to deal with the rised water table.
[img](imgs/20210410)

## 20210410 Plumping Research

Day off the physical work, but did real hard research on plumping, PVC
connection and venting.

## 20210411 Plumping Research

Day off the physical work.

## 20210412 Plumping Research

Day off the physical work.

## 20210413 Plumping Research

Day off the physical work.

## 20210414 Drywell

Knock a rock off the foundation. Put more bricks in the drywell, water table is too high, my drywell will be turned to a leach field. Hammer tested the PVC pipe, not as strong as PE pipe, but still not very easy to crash.

[img](imgs/20210415)

## 20210414 Drywell

One day later, the water only low down 1cm or so, not too good. After cutting
foundation stone with grinder and clay inlet pipe with an ax, now I get the
grade I need for the main drain pipe.

[img](imgs/20210415)

## 20210416 MasterLi

After last night's rain, the water level of my leach field did not raise at all, surprise! MasterLi came, he suggested use plasterboard to cover everything on the ceiling. I wanted to polish and expose some of the beams, he said the wax oil will cost a fortune. His plan is to make the plasterboard part of the compact roof, no attic space, so no need to vent. I think it is a great idea.

## 20210417 grade

After Knocking two big rocks off the foundation. Now I finally had enough room
for the pipes. I followed these steps to get the grade. S1. Try to get as low
as possible at the outlet of the tank, fix one end the PVC pipe there. S2.
Make the other end at the same level. S3. Since it is a 4m pipe, then I need
the end close to the foundation 10cm higher, so I use two bricks above the
original ground. S4. Get the outside end of the pipe going through the house
wall at the same level of the S3 end. S5. Get inside the room, get the other
end at the same level of the outside end, that is make the pipe perfectly
horizontal. S6, since it is a 2m or so pipe, so add one brick under the pipe.

## 20210418 Plumping plan
Img 1 is the plumbing plan, Img2 is the floor plan for things.

[img](imgs/20210418)

## 20210419 leach field
Build the foundation of my half drywell half leach field. the shape is like a Github fork icon, will cover the channels with concrete slabs.

[img](imgs/20210419)

## 20210420 Concrete Slab
Build a slab, the left concrete was used to cover some holes.

[img](imgs/20210420)

## 20210421 Glue PVC
It's not easy, requires a lot of attention for these angles.

[img](imgs/20210421)

## 20210422 Rainy Day
Place an order for PVC glazing.

## 20210423 Get Mineral Wool
Went to fetch my mineral wool at a logistics center. the last 24hr rain
flooded my tank system.

[img](imgs/20210423)

## 20210424 Day Off
Research on different windows, fell in love with thermal break aluminum.

## 20210425 Bury PVC
Finally, I could start to bury the PVC pipes, Did the second concrete slab.
After one day, water level dropped 2 or 3 centimeters, not as fast as I
wished.

[img](imgs/20210425)

## 20210426 Plumbing
Reture some foundation rocks, then bury the pipe close to the foundation. When
outlet water is 20cm deep, then that inlet water is at the edge of the lower
side of the pipe, that means no more water or waste goes in to the tank, and
the system is paralyzed.

[img](imgs/20210426)

## 20210427 Interior Plumbing
Laydown all the fittings on the ground, bought some missing fittings. It's hard to get the 45degrees right, when you need to consider grade, sometimes 45+45 is not a 90. Drywell water level bared dropped since yesterday, maybe half a centimeter, hard to tell.

[img](imgs/20210427)

## 20210428 Main Drain Done
By twisting 2 45degree, you get any angle between 90degree and 135degree, so you get your grade.

[img](imgs/20210428)

## 20210429 leach field
Cover leach field.

[img](imgs/20210429)

## 20210430 Spetic tank

[img](imgs/20210430)

## 20210501 Drain Line Done
Main Drain Line was done.

[img](imgs/20210501)

[img](imgs/20210511)

## 20210512~20210530 Moving to Mars

Mars is another home in the village.

## 20210531 Drilling Well

10 ton tower machine and a air drilling machine came. The tower machine was really close to the center of my septic tank when it went by, maybe only 40cm to the slabs. The work started at 3:00pm and ended 6:40pm, with most of time spent on preparing and finishing. First I saw soil pumped out, we used 12m iron pipes to protect this layer to keep dirty water away, then I saw rock ash floating, the rock layer was 20m, then we reached gravel layer at 30m or so deep, now we have water. From 30m to the final 71m, it's rock and gravel layers alternately, water came from the gravel layers as I was told. So I was recommended to add PVC pipes to protect the well from being plugged.

[img](imgs/20210531)

## 20210612 Install Pump

It is a 1100RMB pump.

[img](imgs/20210612)

## 20210615 Floor

2600RMB for the labor, 1200RMB for sand and cement. The foundation was not on
the same level, the end result is the thin part of the concrete is 3cm(as I
was told, but I really suspect it as only 2cm), the thick part is 7cm deep. 5
o'clock in the afternoon, the developers told me, the floor would have cracked
if it would ever crack. So I was lucky.

[img](imgs/20210615)

## 20210618 Gate Pillars

I watched the whole process, and convinced that no matter how much time given,
I can not do it. That is great concrete work the team has done for me.

[img](imgs/20210617)

## 20210622 Concrete Work

Build the bathroom floor myself, not easy. One Spatula cement, three sand, is
the right ratio. Also installed the gate, and ordered windows.

## 20210713 Installing Windows/Doors

It was supprisingly much glue and spary foam used.

[img](imgs/20210713)

## 20210721 Concrete Walkway

It took mum and me 4 days to finish part of the walkway, we only work 3 hours in the morning. I make it really high to be sure when it rains heavily, mud won't cover the surface. Since its a large surface, so proper slope is kept to drive water away. Besides, walking out of the backdoor, the beauty of the flowers shocked me.

[img](imgs/20210721)

## 20210802 More Concrete Walkway

Key Tips: Set the form right before everything. Make solid edges with gravels and no sand before puring concrete.

[img](imgs/20210802)

## 20210807 Remove Clay layer off the roof

The clay layer was there to support the concrete slab in day1, so it has its
own structural use. But since the concrete layer is dry and has its arched
shape, I believe it will stay stong without the soft clay layer as support.


[img](imgs/20210807)

## 20210825 Support Doors

Used bricks to support the doors, and applied some concrete.
