## 20210318 Hotmelt Pipes
now I am master of water. Hotmelted PE and PPR pipes, all was done perfectly, except the most important one the old pipe to PE elbow joint. But I did another old pipe to PE T fitting, and then do pull and Smash test will piler and hammer, it is rock solid. This gave me some confidence on the bad elbow joint. P.S I did a lot of trails and wasted some pipe and fittings.

## 20210319 Rainy Day
Take a day off, more research on plumping.

## 20210320 Water Main
water pipes are buried no less than 35cm deep, much more deep then the original depth, the shelves/tables/stools really helped
