## 20210312 Pipe is 20cm

measured diamater of my new pipe, the old pipe, they all bigger than 20cm, I gets small errors are common, and should not cause issue when I do hot melting. And, building brick road is fun.

## 20210318 Hotmelt Pipes

now I am master of water. Hotmelted PE and PPR pipes, all was done perfectly, except the most important one the old pipe to PE elbow joint. But I did another old pipe to PE T fitting, and then do pull and Smash test will piler and hammer, it is rock solid. This gave me some confidence on the bad elbow joint. P.S I did a lot of trails and wasted some pipe and fittings.

grinder.
[img](imgs/20210406)

## 20210407 Day Off

More research on plumping.

## 20210408 Drywell

Done a lot. NO.1 Installed smart toliet, it's awesome. NO.2 Excavator took
down the concrete cow feeders. NO.3 trench and drywell hole(2.2m deep, reach
water table). NO.4 Build the drywell, use big brick block to cover the water,
then use small brick block to build a flat surface for the bottom of drywell,
then use gravels, then use sand to make the surface really flat, with the help
of my level. The last three imgs are snapshot from Bilibili videos, I am
inspired to change the way I lay down the bricks, and make the well larger
tomorrow.

## 20210409 Day Off

## 20210410 Destroy the Inlet Concrete

Day off the physical work, but did real hard research on plumping, PVC
connection and venting.

## 20210411 Plumping Research

Day off the physical work.

## 20210412 Plumping Research

Day off the physical work.

## 20210413 Plumping Research

Day off the physical work.

## 20210414 Drywell

Knock a rock off the foundation. Put more bricks in the drywell, water table is too high, my drywell will be turned to a leach field. Hammer tested the PVC pipe, not as strong as PE pipe, but still not very easy to crash.

[img](imgs/20210415)

## 20210414 Drywell

One day later, the water only low down 1cm or so, not too good. After cutting
foundation stone with grinder and clay inlet pipe with an ax, now I get the
grade I need for the main drain pipe.

[img](imgs/20210415)

## 20210416 MasterLi

After last night's rain, the water level of my leach field did not raise at all, surprise! MasterLi came, he suggested use plasterboard to cover everything on the ceiling. I wanted to polish and expose some of the beams, he said the wax oil will cost a fortune. His plan is to make the plasterboard part of the compact roof, no attic space, so no need to vent. I think it is a great idea.

## 20210417 grade

After Knocking two big rocks off the foundation. Now I finally had enough room
for the pipes. I followed these steps to get the grade. S1. Try to get as low
as possible at the outlet of the tank, fix one end the PVC pipe there. S2.
Make the other end at the same level. S3. Since it is a 4m pipe, then I need
the end close to the foundation 10cm higher, so I use two bricks above the
original ground. S4. Get the outside end of the pipe going through the house
wall at the same level of the S3 end. S5. Get inside the room, get the other
end at the same level of the outside end, that is make the pipe perfectly
horizontal. S6, since it is a 2m or so pipe, so add one brick under the pipe.

## 20210418 Plumping plan
Img 1 is the plumbing plan, Img2 is the floor plan for things.

[img](imgs/20210418)

## 20210419 leach field
Build the foundation of my half drywell half leach field. the shape is like a Github fork icon, will cover the channels with concrete slabs.

[img](imgs/20210419)

## 20210420 Concrete Slab
Build a slab, the left concrete was used to cover some holes.

[img](imgs/20210420)

## 20210421 Glue PVC
It's not easy, requires a lot of attention for these angles.

[img](imgs/20210421)

## 20210422 Rainy Day
Place an order for PVC glazing.

## 20210423 Get Mineral Wool
Went to fetch my mineral wool at a logistics center. the last 24hr rain
flooded my tank system.

[img](imgs/20210423)

## 20210424 Day Off
Research on different windows, fell in love with thermal break aluminum.

## 20210425 Bury PVC
Finally, I could start to bury the PVC pipes, Did the second concrete slab.
After one day, water level dropped 2 or 3 centimeters, not as fast as I
wished.

[img](imgs/20210425)

## 20210426 Plumbing
Reture some foundation rocks, then bury the pipe close to the foundation. When
outlet water is 20cm deep, then that inlet water is at the edge of the lower
side of the pipe, that means no more water or waste goes in to the tank, and
the system is paralyzed.

[img](imgs/20210426)

## 20210427 Interior Plumbing
Laydown all the fittings on the ground, bought some missing fittings. It's hard to get the 45degrees right, when you need to consider grade, sometimes 45+45 is not a 90. Drywell water level bared dropped since yesterday, maybe half a centimeter, hard to tell.

[img](imgs/20210427)

## 20210428 Main Drain Done
By twisting 2 45degree, you get any angle between 90degree and 135degree, so you get your grade.

[img](imgs/20210428)

## 20210429 leach field
Cover leach field.

[img](imgs/20210429)

## 20210430 Spetic tank
Build structures for the tank, old grave+sand trick for everything, it's fun to use cement to finish the structures and repair some parts of the stone wall.

[img](imgs/20210430)

## 20210501 Drain Line Done
Main Drain Line was done.

[img](imgs/20210501)
